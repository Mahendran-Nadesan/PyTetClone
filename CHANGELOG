Changelog

01-05-2014		Commit 1

- 	Added README

01-05-2014		Project Setup						

- 	Added PyScripter project file, .git files.

01-16-2014		Commit 2 - making tetraminoes		

- 	Added MainScreen.py, 
- 	Got basic tetraminoes working in MainScreen.py.

01-20-2014		Commit 3 - Basic classes, board/tetraminoes, basic movement

- 	Added Board.py, Tetras.py, Pieces.py
- 	Board and Tetras classes have creation and draw methods.
- 	MainScreen.py calls classes, and initiates downward movement.

01-21-2014		Commit 4 - Reduced Draw methods, simple collision checks

- 	Added this CHANGELOG
- 	Board has update method, which includes the current shape's position, and draws from the board 
	class (Tetra no longer has a draw method).
-	Shapes now get checked for collision with the bottom of the board (still need shape-shape 
	collision).
- 	Added Scraps.py for code of potential use.
- 	Cleaned up and commented code.
- 	Reminder to make a second version that uses 2 boards, one for bg, one for accumulating shapes.
	
01-22-2014		Commit 5 - More collision checks

- 	Board now accumulates shapes along y-axis.
- 	Decided to reconstruct Tetras and Board class, so that shapes are just coordinate lists.

01-23-2014		Commit 6 - Redone classes
01-25-2014

- 	Created OldBoard.py and OldTetras.py - not going to branch yet.
- 	Added movement methods (not control/input methods)
- 	Got collisions working better (i.e. y and x axis) - is there a better implementation?
- 	Added some colours
- 	Cleaned up extraneous code

01-26-2014		Commit 7 - Fixed basic timer issue
01-27-2014

- 	Added control/input stuff as function in MainScreen.py (fix later?)
- 	Added a USEREVENT timer to move tetraminoes down independently of left/right/(later, rotate and 
	drop) keypresses.
- 	To do: make sure game doesn't crash when I attempt to move off the regular board.
