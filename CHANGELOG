01-20-2014		Commit 3 - Basic classes, board/tetraminoes, basic movement

- 	Added Board.py, Tetras.py, Pieces.py
- 	Board and Tetras classes have creation and draw methods.
- 	MainScreen.py calls classes, and initiates downward movement.

01-21-2014		Commit 4 - Reduced Draw methods, simple collision checks

- 	Added this CHANGELOG
- 	Board has update method, which includes the current shape's position, and draws from the board 
	class (Tetra no longer has a draw method).
-	Shapes now get checked for collision with the bottom of the board (still need shape-shape 
	collision).
- 	Added Scraps.py for code of potential use.
- 	Cleaned up and commented code.
- 	Reminder to make a second version that uses 2 boards, one for bg, one for accumulating shapes.
	
01-22-2014		Commit 5 - More collision checks

- 	Board now accumulates shapes along y-axis.
- 	Decided to reconstruct Tetras and Board class, so that shapes are just coordinate lists.
